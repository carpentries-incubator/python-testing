<p>To make running the tests as easy as possible, many software development teams implement a strategy called <strong>continuous integration</strong>. As its name implies, continuous integration integrates the test suite into the development process. Every time a change is made to the repository, the continuous integration system builds and checks that code.</p>

</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>Imagine you developed software on a MacOSX computer. Last week, you helped your office mate build and run it on their Linux computer. You’ve made some changes since then.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How can you be sure it will still work if they update their repository when they come back from vacation?</li>
<li>How long will that process take? machine until you try rebuilding it on their machine.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</section>
<p>The typical story in a research lab is that, well, you don’t know whether it will work on your colleagues’ machine until you try rebuilding it on their machine. If you have a build system, it might take a few minutes to update the repository, rebuild the code, and run the tests. If you don’t have a build system, it could take all afternoon just to see if your new changes are compatible.</p>

<p>Scientists are good at creative insights, conceptual understanding, critical analysis, and consuming espresso. Computers are good at following instructions. Science would be more fun if the scientists could just give the computers the instructions and go grab an espresso.</p>
<p>Continuous integration servers allow just that. Based on your instructions, a continuous integration server can:</p>
<ul>
<li>check out new code from a repository</li>
<li>spin up instances of supported operating systems (i.e., various versions of OSX, Linux, Windows, etc.).</li>
<li>spin up those instances with different software versions (i.e., python 2.7 and python 3.0)</li>
<li>run the build and test scripts</li>
<li>check for errors</li>
<li>and report the results.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="giving-instructions">Giving Instructions</h2>
<p>Your mean repository has both code and tests. Let’s add continuous integration to that repository.</p>

<h3 id="travis-ci">Travis-CI</h3>
<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> is a continous integration server hosting platform. It’s commonly used in Ruby development circles as well as in the scientific python community.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Get a Travis-CI Account</h2>
<p>To use Travis, all you need is an account. It’s free.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Someone in your group should sign up for a Travis account.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions on the Travis website to connect your Travis account with GitHub.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>A file called <code>.travis.yml</code> in your repository will signal to Travis that you want to build and test this repository on Travis-CI. Such a file, for our purposes, is very simple:</p>
<pre><code>language: python
python:
  - &quot;2.6&quot;
  - &quot;2.7&quot;
  - &quot;3.2&quot;
  - &quot;3.3&quot;
  - &quot;3.4&quot;
  - &quot;nightly&quot;
# command to install dependencies
install:
  - &quot;pip install -r requirements.txt&quot;
# command to run tests
script: nosetests</code></pre>
<p>You can see how the python package manager, pip, will use your requirements.txt file from the previous exercise. That requirements.txt file is a conventional way to list all of the python packages that we need. If we needed nose, numpy, and pymol, the requirements.txt file would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>nose
numpy
pymol</code></pre>

<li>Commit and push it.</li>

<p>We gave the example of Travis because it’s very very simple to spin up. While it is able to run many flavors of Linux, it currently doesn’t support other platforms as well. Depending on your needs, you may consider other services such as:</p>
<p>= <a href="http://buildbot.net/">buildbot</a> - <a href="http://www.cdash.org/">CDash</a> - <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Servers exist for automatically running your tests</li>
<li>Running the tests can be triggered by a GitHub pull request</li>
<li>CI allows cross platform build testing</li>
<li>A .travis.yml file configures a build on the travis-ci servers</li>
<li>Many free CI servers are available</li>
</ul>
