Before relying on a new experimental device, an experimental scientist always
establishes its accuracy. A new detector is calibrated when the scientist
observes its responses to known input signals. The results of this
calibration are compared against the _expected_ response. **An experimental
scientist would never conduct an experiment with uncalibrated detectors - that
would be unscientific. So too, simulations and analysis with untested
software do not constitute science.**

The collection of all of the tests for a given code is known as the _test
suite_. You can think of the test suite as a bunch of pre-canned experiments
that anyone can run. If all of the test pass, then the code is at least
partially trustworthy. If any of the tests fail then the code is known to be
incorrect with respect to whichever case failed.  After this lesson, you will
know to not trust software when its tests do not _cover_ its claimed
capabilities and when its tests do not pass.

In most other programming endeavors, if code is fundamentally wrong
- even for years at a time - the impact of this error can be relatively small.
Perhaps a website goes down, or a game crashes, or a days worth of writing is
lost to a bug in your word processor. Scientific code, on the other hand,
controls planes, weapons systems, satellites, agriculture, and most importantly
scientific simulations and experiments. If the software that governs the
computational or physical experiment is wrong, then disasters (such as false
claims in a publication) will result.

This is not to say that scientists have a monopoly on software testing, simply
that software cannot be called _scientific_ unless it has been validated.

> draws on the fact that after its initial creation, tests provide

> tests to provide examples of code use, even brand new programs are unsustainable.

Testing is the calibration step of the computational simulation and analysis
world: it lets the scientist trust their own work on a fundamental level and
helps others to understand and trust their work as well.
Furthermore, tests help you to never fix a bug a second time. Once a bug has
been caught and a test has been written, that particular bug can never again
re-enter the codebase unnoticed. So, whether motivated by principles or a
desire to work more efficiently, all scientists can benefit from testing.


> ## Prerequisites
>
> You should have a basic understanding of Python variables and functions are a
> necessary prerequisite. Some previous experience with the shell and git
> is expected. If you have done an Software Carpentry course with Python, Shell
> and Git, then you are suffiecently prepared for this course.
>
> You are *not* expected to be familiar with pytest (the Python library we will
> be using), nor with the new Python concepts we will cover.
